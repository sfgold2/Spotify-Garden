# Spotify React

This is a project I created with a team for ZotHacks.

## Description

Spotify React is a web application that displays characteristics of songs from a Spotify user's listening history as a garden of multi-colored flowers. We created the application with React.js and Node.js, as well as Postman to fetch the Spotify API.
